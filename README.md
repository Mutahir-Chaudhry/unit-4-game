# unit-4-game
What the project does

This project is a game that starts with a random number displayed. Below you will find 4 crystal buttons. Each button is assigned a random number between 1-12, while the random number generated is between 19-120. The values are never displayed but rather added to a number below the crystals labeled your score. If you click the crystals and manage to add the number up to the random number, a win is added to your wins and loses counter, and the game rests. If your score goes over the random number, a lose is added to your wins and loses and the game resets. 

Why the project is useful

This project is useful becuase it helps us put jQuery into use and solidify our understanding as to what DOM manipulation is. It also helped me personally better understand how .setAttribute works as well as (this) when used in jQuery.
